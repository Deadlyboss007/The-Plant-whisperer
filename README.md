An Aeroponics-Based System to Enhance Plant Growth by Chemically Communicating with Plants

The idea is to use Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released by plants to detect their growth, diseases, and deficiencies. By reverse-engineering this biological process, synthetic 'activator' VOCs can be produced to boost plant growth. AI/ML and NLP can be used to recognize plant ailments and provide them with proper nourishment, fertilizers, etc. This will help farmers to achieve higher yields and reduce crop losses.
